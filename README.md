# ðŸ§  Amadeus
Amadeus is a **Discord Bot** that enables users to chat with an artificial intelligence modeled after the Amadeus AI from the Steins;Gate 0 anime. Amadeus uses OpenAI's GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) model.

## Technologies
Amadeus is currently hosted on [Replit](https://amadeus.thomasjvu.repl.co), and uses Node.js on the backend with the Express framework to keep the bot running even when the replit is closed. The frontend uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

### NPM Packages
- OpenAI
- Express
- Discord.js

## Optimizations
Currently, the Amadeus bot is only able to answer one-off questions, and does not continue a conversation from where it has left off. The goal is for Amadeus to have tha bility to converse with multiple Discord users at a single time, remembering its conversation with each user.
